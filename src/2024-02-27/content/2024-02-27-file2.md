# Document Databases
## An overview of Document Databases
Strongly document-oriented databases organize data into self-contained units called aggregates. Each aggregate has a unique key and its internal structure is visible, though with limitations on what kind of data it can hold. Accessing information happens through queries based on the fields within the aggregate itself. These documents, often stored in JSON or similar formats, can have a hierarchical structure with nested elements like arrays and objects. While documents within a collection share some similarities, their exact schema can vary, offering flexibility in how data is organized. This approach contrasts with traditional relational databases where data is spread across multiple tables with predefined relationships.

```json
    key=3 -> {  "personID": 3,
                "firstname": "Martin",
                "likes": [ "Biking","Photography" ],
                "lastcity": "Boston",
                "visited": [ "NYC", "Paris" ] }

    key=5 -> {  "personID": 5,
                "firstname": "Pramod",
                "citiesvisited": [ "Chicago", "London","NYC" ],
                "addresses": [
                { "state": "AK",
                "city": "DILLINGHAM" },
                { "state": "MH",
                "city": "PUNE" } ],
                "lastcity": "Chicago" }
```

## Queries in Document Databases: an example using MondoDB syntax
MongoDB, a popular document database, empowers you to retrieve and manipulate information using a powerful query language. This language, remarkably, is built upon JSON, making it familiar and intuitive for developers.  Just like you construct JSON documents, you can craft queries that specify exactly which data you need. These queries leverage various clauses to filter results (where), arrange the order (sort), calculate aggregates (count, sum), and more, giving you precise control over the data you extract.

An example of **SQL queries**:
```sql
    SELECT * FROM users

    SELECT * FROM users WHERE personID = 3

    SELECT firstname, lastcity FROM users WHERE personID = 5
```

The counterparts written in **MongoDB syntax**:
```java
    db.users.find()

    db.users.find( { "personID": 3 } )

    db.users.find( { "personID":5},{"firstname":1,"lastcity":1} )
```
