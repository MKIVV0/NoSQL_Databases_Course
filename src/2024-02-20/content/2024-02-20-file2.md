# Commenting on Relational Databases
## What about RDBMSs? - A brief review of Relational Databases
**RDBMSs** are the **predominant database technology** nowadays. They have been first defined in 1970 by Edgar Codd in **IBM's research labs**. In the relational case, data is modeled as **relations**, representing the cartesian product between two domains:
- an **object** corresponds to a **tuple** composed of attribute values, each of which has its own domain;
- a **table** is a set of objects of the same type;
- different tables and their objects are interconnected via **foreign keys**.

As for the declarative language used, relational databases employ **relational calculus**, which is encompassed in the standardized **SQL query language**.

## What's the value of relational databses?
Relational databases have stood the test of time, becoming **highly standardized**. Many **well-developed technologies** have been built upon them, including the **physical organization** of data, **search indexes**, **query optimization**, and **search operator** implementations. The relational model excels in providing **effective concurrency control** through the implementation of **ACID** rules â€” ensuring **atomicity**, **consistency**, **isolation**, and **durability** for transactions.

Modern RDBMSs are also **seamlessly integrated** with diverse technologies, including programming languages. In conclusion, the relational model is **well-established**, **mature**, and enjoys **extensive support**.

## The trends & requirements of database systems
The trends and requirements of database systems are being driven by the **increasing volume**, **velocity**, and **variety** of data. Traditional relational databases are **struggling** to keep up with these demands, and new types of databases, such as **graph databases** and **NoSQL databases**, are emerging to meet the challenge.

- **Cloud computing** is a major trend in database systems, as it allows organizations to scale their databases up or down as needed and to avoid the costs of managing their own hardware and software.

- **Real database scalability** is essential for handling ever-growing data volumes. Massively distributed systems and horizontally scaling systems are two approaches to achieving real database scalability.

- **Dynamic resource management** is another important requirement for database systems, as it allows them to efficiently allocate resources based on the current workload.

- **Big users who require massive read throughput**, such as social media applications, are driving the need for databases that can handle a large number of concurrent users.

- **The variety of data** that needs to be stored is also increasing, as organizations collect data from a wider range of sources, including social media, sensors, and the Internet of Things (IoT). This is driving the need for flexible database schemas that can accommodate different data types and structures, such as semi-structured data.

While RDBMS have served well for structured data of a defined nature, they struggle to keep pace with the evolving demands of big data.

- **Rigid schema**: Unlike RDBMS with their fixed schema, big data often requires flexibility to accommodate diverse and evolving data structures. This inflexibility in RDBMS can become a major roadblock.

- **Query complexity**: The process of normalizing data in RDBMS, while ensuring data integrity, can lead to intricate queries involving joins across various tables. These complex queries become sluggish when dealing with massive datasets, hindering the real-time performance big data applications often require.

- **ACID transactions**: Designed to maintain data integrity in smaller datasets, the ACID guarantees offered by RDBMS transactions become a burden in a distributed big data environment. This translates to significant processing slowdowns.

As a result, big data solutions increasingly move towards alternative storage options like NoSQL databases or graph databases. These options offer greater flexibility and faster performance when handling the unique challenges of big data, allowing organizations to unlock its full potential.
