# Course Introduction - February 20th, 2024
This lecture explores the growing importance of **NoSQL databases**. It begins by examining the trends and requirements of modern database systems, highlighting scenarios where NoSQL excels compared to traditional relational databases (RDBMS).  

The lecture then dives into the various NoSQL **data models** and their properties, showcasing the advantages they offer for specific **data storage** and **processing needs**.  While RDBMS strengths are acknowledged, the focus is on understanding NoSQL's **capabilities** and **potential challenges**.

# Notes
<p id="footnote-1"><a href=#footnote-1-ref>[1]</a> With the term <b>sheer</b> we're emphasizing the <b>magnitude</b>, the <b>size of the data</b>, without introducing qualifiers or restrictions.

<p id="footnote-2"><a href=#footnote-2-ref>[2]</a> In a <b>normalized</b> data model, data is organized to <b>reduce redundancy</b> and <b>improve data integrity</b>. This is achieved by breaking down data into tables and establishing relationships between the two, which can involve splitting the data into separate tables and linking them with foreign keys. On the other hand, a <b>denormalized</b> data model involves combining tables and information to <b>simplify queries</b> and <b>increase read performance</b>. This means that <b>redundant data</b> may be stored in multiple places to <b>avoid joins and increase query speed</b>. While this can improve query performance, it may <b>sacrifice</b> some aspects of data integrity and can lead to data redundancy.</p>

<p id="horizontal-scaling"><a href="#horizontal-scaling-ref">[3]</a> <b>Horizontal scaling</b>, <b>or scale-out</b>, is a method of <b>increasing system capacity</b> by <b>adding more independent machines or nodes</b> to <b>distribute and handle workloads</b>. This approach <b>enhances redundancy</b>, offers <b>linear scalability</b>, and is <b>cost-effective</b>, commonly facilitated by cloud computing and containerization technologies. <b>Challenges</b> include ensuring <b>data consistency</b> and <b>effective workload distribution</b>. Notable examples include adding machines to a network or using container orchestration tools like Kubernetes.</p>

<p id="impedance-mismatch"><a href=#impedance-mismatch-ref>[4]</a> As of 2024, some relational databases support JSON as a data type, e.g. <b>PostgreSQL</b>. Nevertheless, the concept of impedance mismatch remains the same: if the presented data were stored in, say, a Java object, how would one proceed to store it in a relational database?</p>
