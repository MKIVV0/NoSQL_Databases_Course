## Why opt for Non-Relational Databases?
In an era increasingly driven by technology, the sheer<sub><a id="footnote-1-ref" href=#footnote-1>[1]</a></sub> <b>volume of data</b> processed by devices, such as computers, is experiencing <b>exponential growth</b>. This prompts a critical question: <strong>why do we need a class of databases that diverges from traditional relational models?</strong>
<br><br>
Given the vast volume of information processed and exchanged by computers in today's world, originating from <b>diverse sources</b> and exhibiting <b>various structures</b>, there's a compelling need for systems that are fast, reliable, and efficient in handling such diverse datasets.
<br><br>
In such a case, we can use the term <strong>Big Data</strong> to refer to information that contains greater variety arriving in increasing volumes and with ever-higher velocity. In particular, this term refers to datasets whose size is beyond the ability of typical database software tools to capture, store, manage, and analyze. We have, therefore, three dimensions that characterize this class of data:
<ul>
    <li><strong>Variety</strong>, which refers to the diverse types of data that can be encountered. This includes structured data (e.g., databases), unstructured data (e.g., text, images, videos), and semi-structured data (e.g., XML and JSON files).</li>
    <li><strong>Volume</strong>, which represent the sheer size or scale of the data being generated or collected. It refers to the vast amounts of data that exced the capacity of traditional database systems.</li>
    <li><strong>Velocity</strong>, the speed at which data is generated, processed, and made available for analysis. It emphasizes the real-time or near-real-time nature of data streams.</li>
</ul>
The following image shows a diagram comparing <b>big data</b> and <b>normal processing capabilities</b>. It depicts the vast difference in the amount of data that big data can handle compared to normal processing capacity:

</div>

## How can we quantify big data?
The <b>overwhelming volume</b> of data is a key aspect in big data. Traditionally, datasets on the order of <b>terabytes (TB)</b>, <b>petabytes (PB)</b>, or even <b>zettabytes (ZB)</b>, are considered as falling into the realm of big data.
For comparison purposes, here is the <b>byte scale</b>:
- \\(1\ Zettabyte = 2^{70}\ bytes\\)
- \\(1\ Exabyte = 2^{60}\ bytes\\)
- \\(1\ Petabyte = 2^{50}\ bytes\\)
- \\(1\ Terabyte = 2^{40}\ bytes\\)
- \\(1\ Gigabyte = 2^{30}\ bytes\\) 
- \\(1\ Megabyte = 2^{20}\ bytes\\) 
- \\(1\ Kilobyte = 2^{10}\ bytes\\) 
- \\(1\ Byte = 2^{3}\ bits\\) 

These values illustrate the increasing magnitudes of data storage.
The following image shows how the global generation of data increases annually:

## What kind of data are we considering?
As mentioned before, data can be classified into three categories:
- <b>Structured Data</b> refers to well-organized, tabular data with a clear schema. This includes data stored in relational databases and spreadsheets. Big data applications may involve large volumes of structured data, especially when dealing with historical records, transactional data, or standardized information. <br>
- <b>Semi-structured Data</b> is a class of data that has some level of structure, but does not conform to the rigid structure of traditional relational databases. It may have tags, hierarchies, or key-value pairs. JSON and XML are included in this class. Big data applications may leverage semi-structured data formats for flexibility and scalability, such as handling data with varying attributes or evolving schemas. <br>
- <b>Unstructured Data</b> is a category of data that lacks a predefined data model or is not organized in a tabular structure. It includes text, images, audio, and video. Big data applications often deal with massive amounts of unstructured data, such as sentiment analysis on social media, image recognition, or natural language processing.

In fact, the following image shows the increasing treatment of unstructured data over structured data, as time goes on:

As for Big Data sources, they comprise <b>social networks</b>, <b>logs of various web/email servers or routers</b>, <b>sensor networks</b>, <b>IoT devices</b>.

## Data Processing
In the expansive landscape of big data, efficient data processing is achieved through the orchestration of three key paradigms:
- <b>OLTP (Online Transaction Processing)</b>: it's a type of data processing that consists of executing a number of <b>transactions</b> occuring <b>concurrently</b>, such as <b>online banking</b>, <b>shopping</b>, <b>order entry</b>, or sending <b>text messages</b>. These transactions traditionally are referred to as <b>economic or financial</b> transactions, recorded and secured so that an enterprise can access the information anytime for <b>accounting or reporting</b> issues. In short, it enables the <b>real-time execution</b> of large numbers of transactions by large numbers of people;

- <b>OLAP (Online Analytical Processing)</b>: it focuses on <b>complex queries</b> and <b>data analysis</b>. OLAP systems are optimized for <b>analytical and ad-hoc queries</b>, involving aggregations, grouping, and multidimensional analysis. They are <b>read-heavy</b>, designed for <b>data warehousing</b> and <b>business intelligence</b> applications, typically using a <b>denormalized</b><sub><a id="footnote-2-ref" href=#footnote-2></a></sub> data model to improve query performance.

- <b>RTAP (Real-Time Analytics Processing)</b>: aiming to provide <b>real-time analytical</b> capabilities on transactional data, RTAP systems offer <b>near-real-time analysis</b> on <b>streaming or transactional</b> data. These systems often have a <b>hybrid architecture</b> combining elements of OLTP and OLAP, enabling fast and analytical processing on <b>live data</b>. RTAP systems are designed to handle <b>high-velocity data streams</b> and <b>scale horizontally</b><sub><a id="horizontal-scaling-ref" href=#horizontal-scaling>[3]</a></sub> to accomodate growing data volumes.

## Technologies for Big Data
As of today, we have different means to handle and manage <b>big data</b>:
- <b>Data Management Systems</b>, i.e. NoSQL databases;
- <b>Models for distributed programming</b>, i.e. MapReduce and others;
- <b>Grid and cloud computing</b>, e.g AWS;
- <b>Large-Scale Machine Learning</b>, e.g. Hadoop, Tensorflow and Pytorch.

This course focuses, as mentioned before and as the book title states, on NoSQL databases. The other cited elements will be treated in the <a href="https://uninsubria.coursecatalogue.cineca.it/insegnamenti/2024/25783/2018/9999/10088?coorte=2023&schemaid=5367">Cloud Computing course</a>, which will be conducted next year by the same lecturer of this course.

## What about RDBMSs? - A brief review of Relational Databases
<b>RDBMSs</b> are the <b>predominant database technology</b> nowadays. They have been first defined in 1970 by Edgar Codd in <b>IBM's research labs</b>. In the relational case, data is modeled as <b>relations</b>, representing the cartesian product between two domains:
- an <b>object</b> corresponds to a <b>tuple</b> composed of attribute values, each of which has its own domain;
- a <b>table</b> is a set of objects of the same type;
- different tables and their objects are interconnected via <b>foreign keys</b>.

As for the declarative language used, relational databases employ <b>relational calculus</b>, which is encompassed in the standardized <b>SQL query language</b>.

## What's the value of relational databses?</strong> 
Relational databases have stood the test of time, becoming <b>highly standardized</b>. Many <b>well-developed technologies</b> have been built upon them, including the <b>physical organization</b> of data, <b>search indexes</b>, <b>query optimization</b>, and <b>search operator</b> implementations. The relational model excels in providing <b>effective concurrency control</b> through the implementation of <b>ACID</b> rules â€” ensuring <b>atomicity</b>, <b>consistency</b>, <b>isolation</b>, and <b>durability</b> for transactions.

Modern RDBMSs are also <b>seamlessly integrated</b> with diverse technologies, including programming languages. In conclusion, the relational model is <b>well-established</b>, <b>mature</b>, and enjoys <b>extensive support</b>.

## The trends & requirements of database systems
The trends and requirements of database systems are being driven by the <b>increasing volume</b>, <b>velocity</b>, and <b>variety</b> of data. Traditional relational databases are <b>struggling</b> to keep up with these demands, and new types of databases, such as <b>graph databases</b> and <b>NoSQL databases</b>, are emerging to meet the challenge.

- <b>Cloud computing</b> is a major trend in database systems, as it allows organizations to scale their databases up or down as needed and to avoid the costs of managing their own hardware and software.

- <b>Real database scalability</b> is essential for handling ever-growing data volumes. Massively distributed systems and horizontally scaling systems are two approaches to achieving real database scalability.

- <b>Dynamic resource management</b> is another important requirement for database systems, as it allows them to efficiently allocate resources based on the current workload.

- <b>Big users who require massive read throughput</b>, such as social media applications, are driving the need for databases that can handle a large number of concurrent users.

- <b>The variety of data</b> that needs to be stored is also increasing, as organizations collect data from a wider range of sources, including social media, sensors, and the Internet of Things (IoT). This is driving the need for flexible database schemas that can accommodate different data types and structures, such as semi-structured data.

While RDBMS have served well for structured data of a defined nature, they struggle to keep pace with the evolving demands of big data.

- <b>Rigid schema</b>: Unlike RDBMS with their fixed schema, big data often requires flexibility to accommodate diverse and evolving data structures. This inflexibility in RDBMS can become a major roadblock.

- <b>Query complexity</b>: The process of normalizing data in RDBMS, while ensuring data integrity, can lead to intricate queries involving joins across various tables. These complex queries become sluggish when dealing with massive datasets, hindering the real-time performance big data applications often require.

- <b>ACID transactions</b>: Designed to maintain data integrity in smaller datasets, the ACID guarantees offered by RDBMS transactions become a burden in a distributed big data environment. This translates to significant processing slowdowns.

As a result, big data solutions increasingly move towards alternative storage options like NoSQL databases or graph databases. These options offer greater flexibility and faster performance when handling the unique challenges of big data, allowing organizations to unlock its full potential.

## The NoSQL class
While the term "NoSQL" may have originated as an "accidental term with no precise definition" in 2009, it has evolved to represent a diverse range of database solutions specifically designed to address the limitations of traditional relational databases (RDBMS) when dealing with big data.

Unlike the rigid, pre-defined schema of RDBMS, NoSQL databases offer greater flexibility and scalability, making them well-suited for handling the volume, variety, and velocity of big data.
Nowadays, the term <b>NoSQL</b> commonly stands for <b>Not Only SQL</b>. <br>

<b>Is it just another temporary trend?</b> There have been attempts to diverge from or to revolutionalize the relational model, such as <b>object databases</b> and <b>XML databases</b>.

<b>TO CONTINUE</b>

## NoSQL Properties in more detail

## The challenges of NoSQL databases

Nonetheless, more and more companies accept the weak points and choose NoSQL databases for their strengths. NoSQL technologies are also often used as <b>secondary databases</b> for specific <b>data processing</b>. For more, refer to the two following links:
- <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/who-uses-mongodb">Who uses mongodb</a>
- <a href="http://neo4j.com/customers/">Neo4j - customers</a>

So, <b>is it the end of relational databases?</b> No, the relational model is still ideal for some applications, where structured data are required. It is also important to note that it's still the predominant model. Therefore, a <b>polyglot persistence</b> is possible: different data stores are used in different circumstances. <br>
There are <b>two trends</b>, nowadays:
- NoSQL databases are implementing relational features;
- RDBMSs are integrating NoSQL principles.

## Data models in the NoSQL family.
A data model is an abstract representation that defines and organizes the structure and relationships of data. It acts like a blueprint, outlining how data elements (representing real-world entities) are organized, stored, and retrieved within a system.

NoSQL databases come in various forms, each with its own data model. These models differ from the structured tables of RDBMS and can include:
- <b>Document stores</b>: Data is stored as self-contained documents, similar to JSON or XML files, allowing for flexible schema and easy integration of diverse data structures.
- <b>Key-value stores</b>: Data is stored as key-value pairs, offering fast retrieval based on the unique key.
- <b>Wide-column stores</b>: Data is stored in column families, where each column can have different properties and data types.
- <b>Graph databases</b>: Data is represented as nodes and edges, allowing efficient modeling of relationships between entities.


## Aggregate orientation
In the realm of <b>data management</b>, traditional relational database management systems (RDBMS) operate on individual <b>tuples, producing results in a <b>tuple format</b>. However, the evolving needs of modern applications demand a more <b>sophisticated approach</b> to handling data, one that goes beyond the <b>constraints</b> of individual tuples. 

This shift in perspective is encapsulated in the concept of <b>aggregate orientation</b>. In contemporary applications and NoSQL databases, data is treated as <b>cohesive units or aggregates</b> rather than isolated tuples. <b>Aggregate orientation</b> signifies a paradigm where data, often <b>complex</b> and <b>multifaceted</b>, is viewed and managed as integrated entities, acknowledging the intricate relationships within datasets. 

This approach recognizes that real-world data often comes in <b>complex structures</b> that are better represented and processed as cohesive entities. Aggregates, in this context, become the <b>building blocks</b>, offering a more <b>flexible</b> and holistic way to manage data. This concept finds resonance across various NoSQL database types, including key-value, wide-column, and document-oriented datastores, where the handling of aggregates aligns with the diverse and dynamic nature of modern data.

## Design strategy

## Notes
<p id="footnote-1"><a href=#footnote-1-ref>[1]</a> With the term <b>sheer</b>, we're emphasizing the <b>magnitude</b>, the <b>size of the data</b>, without introducing qualifiers or restrictions.
<p id="footnote-2"><a href=#footnote-2-ref>[2]</a> In a <b>normalized</b> data model, data is organized to <b>reduce redundancy</b> and <b>improve data integrity</b>. This is achieved by breaking down data into tables and establishing relationships between the two, which can involve splitting the data into separate tables and linking them with foreign keys. On the other hand, a <b>denormalized</b> data model involves combining tables and information to <b>simplify queries</b> and <b>increase read performance</b>. This means that <b>redundant data</b> may be stored in multiple places to <b>avoid joins and increase query speed</b>. While this can improve query performance, it may <b>sacrifice</b> some aspects of data integrity and can lead to data redundancy.</p>
<p id="horizontal-scaling"><a href="#horizontal-scaling-ref">[3]</a> <b>Horizontal scaling</b>, <b>or scale-out</b>, is a method of <b>increasing system capacity</b> by <b>adding more independent machines or nodes</b> to <b>distribute and handle workloads</b>. This approach <b>enhances redundancy</b>, offers <b>linear scalability</b>, and is <b>cost-effective</b>, commonly facilitated by cloud computing and containerization technologies. <b>Challenges</b> include ensuring <b>data consistency</b> and <b>effective workload distribution</b>. Notable examples include adding machines to a network or using container orchestration tools like Kubernetes.</p>
